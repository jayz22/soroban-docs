Soroban is still under active development. While the fee model described here is
unlikely to change, the exact values of the fee rates and limits remain
undetermined.

# Fee Model

Executing a Soroban transaction on the Stellar network requires a fee. This
measure helps prevent spam and allows multiple parties to compete for inclusion
in the ledger in case of traffic surges. The fee is paid using the native
Stellar token (lumens, also known as XLM).

The Soroban transaction fee comprises two parts: the resource fee and the
inclusion fee.

The resource fee is the amount of lumens the submitter must pay for their
transaction to be included in the ledger. It depends solely on the amount of
resources the transaction needs for execution. There is no auction for the
resource fee; it simply must be paid if the transaction is included in the
ledger.

The inclusion fee is the maximum fee bid the submitter is willing to pay for
inclusion. It is used to prioritize transactions â€” the transaction with the
higher inclusion fee is included in the ledger before those with lower
inclusion fees. The inclusion fee can be discounted depending on the
traffic. If the ledger is not at capacity, only the minimal base fee
is charged (100 stroops or 10^-5 XLM). If the ledger is at capacity, then
the lowest inclusion fee bid is charged. In general, the behavior of the
inclusion fee and bidding strategies align with the [classic Stellar fees].

The remainder of this chapter focuses on resource fees, as they are specific to
Soroban.

## Resource fee

Soroban uses a multi-dimensional fee model that charges fees for several
resource types using network-defined rates. The resource fee is calculated
based on the resource consumption declared in the transaction. If the
transaction attempts to exceed the declared resource limit, it will fail. If
the transaction uses fewer resources than declared, there will be no refunds,
with a few exceptions.

The resource fee depends on the following:

- Instructions: the number of CPU instructions the transaction uses, metered by
  the Soroban host.
- Ledger entry accesses: Reading or writing any single ledger entry (any storage
  key in the contract context).
- Ledger I/O: The number of bytes read from or written to the ledger.
- Transaction size: The size of the transaction submitted to the network in
  bytes.
- Metadata size: The size of the metadata produced by the contract. Metadata
  consists of the changed ledger entries (essentially an additional charge for
  ledger I/O) and size of the events emitted by the contract.

Some parameters may contribute to multiple fee components. For example, the
transaction size is charged for network propagation (as network bandwidth is
limited) and for historical storage (as storing ledger history is not free).

The implementation details for fee computation are provided by the following
[library](https://github.com/stellar/rs-soroban-env/blob/main/soroban-env-host/src/fees.rs). This library is used by the protocol to compute the fees and thus can be considered 
canonical.  The resource fee rates may be updated based on network validator
consensus.

The precise network fee rates will be defined in the upcoming mainnet release.
The Futurenet preview release uses placeholder values.

The best way to find the required fees for any Soroban transaction is to use
the transaction simulation with 
[preflight service](./interacting-with-contracts.mdx#preflight).

### Refundable resources

The only refundable resource at the moment is metadata. If the transaction emits
less metadata than declared, the network will refund the difference in fees.

## Resource limits

Ledger close time is constrained to a few seconds, thus preventing the execution
of arbitrarily large transactions, regardless of the resource fees involved.
All the resources referenced in the prior section are subject to a per-transaction
limit. Additionally, the memory (RAM) usage by a transaction is capped, though
it is not subject to any charge.

The limits are may change in the mainnet release. They can
also be updated, usually increased, based on the network
validator consensus.

The current (Futurenet) limits are as follows:

| Resource            | Limit      |
|---------------------|------------|
| CPU Instructions    | 40,000,000 |
| RAM                 | 50 MB      |
| Ledger Entry Reads  | 40         |
| Ledger Entry Writes | 20         |
| Ledger Read Bytes   | 200 KB     |
| Ledger Write Bytes  | 100 KB     |
| Transaction Size    | 100 KB     |
| Metadata Size       | 200 KB     |

Apart from these resource limits, there is also a maximum contract size limit 
of 64 KB.
